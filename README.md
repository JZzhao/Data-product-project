##Introduction

This repository is created for the final project of the 'Developing Data Products' Coursera course. The repository consists of three final project submission files:


ui.R 
server.R 
README.md 


The ui.R and server.R are the code I have written for the final project shiny application named Iris Species Prediction. Following are the final project submission links of my iris species prediction shiny application and RStudio presentation slides:
